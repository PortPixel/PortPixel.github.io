    <div class="content">

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
       <p>What makes a good game great? There are millions of games out there, most of them free to play, but what makes a game stand out? What makes it truely brilliant, rather than just 'good'? This article will help you turn your games into from 'it was good', to 'that game was the most fun ever!'.</p>

       <p> NOTE : If you haven't created any games yet, I would recommend you start with <a href="gettingstartedarticles.html">these articles</a>.</p>

      <h3><a name="aesthetics">Aesthetics</a></h3>
       <p>If you do not know the difference between graphics and aesthetics, please read <a href="graphicsvsaesthetics.html">this article</a> first.</p>
       <p>The aesthetics of a game is how it looks and feels. Put simply, the aesthetic of a game is how it looks and feels. A game with good graphics can still have bad aesthetics if it doesn't have a good 'style'. A game with bad graphics can still have a great aesthetic if the style of the game is great. Take an old Mario platformer for example. Those games have bad graphics; simple 2D pixely art mainly. Yet they are still regarded as great games. Why? Because their style is great. Their classic look and feel is what make is why they have a good aesthetic, despite the fact that their graphics are bad by today's standards.</p>
       <p>Therefore, the aesthetic of a game is very important. For example, if you want to make a platformer, you should decide what style the game should have before you even start coding or creating any graphics for it.</p>

      <h3>Make it unique</h3>
       <p>If you want your game to be played lots, you have to make it stand out. And with millions of <a href="../../games/playgames.html">games</a> available to play online, the best way to make your games stand out is to make it unique. A game that is the same as thousands of others will not be rememberable, however a game with a unique style or <a href="#aesthetics">aesthetic</a> will be memorable. If people find a game memorable, they are more likely to play it again, or recomend it to others. A memorable game will also get much better reviews compared to a non-memorable game.</p>
       <p>A good way of thinking of unique ideas for games is to play other <a href="../../games/playgames.html">games</a>, and then brainstorm ways that you could mix 2 or mores of the ideas behind the games together. An example of this could be Clash of Clans. It took the idea of an online game and a medieval game, and turned it into an online game with characters from medieval time (e.g. archers or barbarians). This created a fairly unique <a href="#aesthetics">aesthetic</a> for the game, and made Supercell millions as a result.</p>

      <h3>Keep it engaging</h3>
       <p>This may seem obvious, but a surprising number of <a href="../../games/playgames.html">games</a> tend to lose the player's interest during long, badly thought out cut scenes or during repetitive, easy levels. An easy way to solve this is to vary level type or include powerups. This will break up repetitive chunks of gameplay and keep the player interested.</p>
       <p><a name="hooks">Another</a> way to keep a game interesting is to make it just difficult enough to be challenging, while still allowing the player to achieve small accomplishments that compel them to keep playing. This hooks a player on trying to 'beat' the game or a highscore. Another way of keeping the player engaged is to have a leveling system. This makes the player think they are achieving something, while the game still doesn't have to have an 'end'. In a game using a system like that the players never feel like they have completed the game, and there is nothing left for then to do. Therefore, they never have to quit, as long as you keep the game interesting to play.</p>
       <p>A good example of a game that uses the highscore 'hook' is Flappy Bird. It is very difficult to get a good score on that game, but easy to start playing. Because you slowly get higher and higher scores, you feel like you are achieving something, even though there isn't an actual end to the game.</p>

      <h3>Smooth Gameplay</h3>
       <p>There is no better way to annoy gamers than a laggy game. It doesn't matter how good the storyline or aesthetics are, if it lags, people are not going to enjoy it. Take Terraria for iOS for example. It used to be, and still is to an extent, a great game that consumed too many hours I probably should have spent doing something more worthwhile. However, Terraria is now too laggy to run properly on my iPad, so I don't play it anymore.</p>
       <p>And that's a shame, both from my point of view (I can't properly play it anymore) and Re-Logic's point of view (they have lost someone playing their game). At some point, I may buy a more powerful iPad, like the iPad Pro, and Terraria will probably run fine on that. But this does show that smooth gameplay is crucial to making a great game. If it lags... people just won't play it.</p>

      <h3>Make it easy to start playing</h3>
       <p>A good game should be easy to start playing, but hard to master. That way people don't just give up because they feel they can't get anywhere, and also won't quit because they feel like they have completed the game and there is nothing left for them to do. In other words, use a <a href="#hooks">hook</a>.</p>
       <p>A good example of a game that is hard to master but easy to play is Agario. Anyone can play that game, but to learn when to split, who to team with and who to try to eat takes a lot of pratice and time, which results in more people online on Agario's servers, which in turn makes it better to play. If no one went on Agario, it would be pretty boring. The entire point of the game is to become big and get that no.1 spot on the leader board. You may end up yelling at the computer because someone has just eaten you, or when you finally get that no.1 spot just when your internet drops out, but Agario is (normally) fun regardless of it being slightly annoying at times.</p>

      <h3>Make it playable for different lengths of time</h3>
       <p>This is crucial, but depends on what you want your game to be played on. If your game is a mobile game, you should make it playable for a short amount of time as well as longer gaming sessions. The reason for this is mobile games are normally played during small amounts of time, like lunch breaks or travel for example. On the other hand, console games are usually played for longer amounts of time and the games should reflect that. Also, console games are generally more in depth and cost more than mobile games.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
       <p>There is no set way to make a great game, for the simple reason that great games are unique. However if you follow the tips above, you can turn your games from 'good' 'that game was the most fun ever!'. </p>
